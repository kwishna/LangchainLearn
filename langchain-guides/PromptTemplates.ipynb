    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use LangChain for creating chat-based prompt templates for the GPT-like language model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing these templates allows for dynamic and flexible interactions with large language models, ensuring we can harness their full potential for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Using Prompt Templates**:\n",
    "1. *Consistency*: Same tasks can be executed across sessions with standardized prompts.\n",
    "2. *Efficiency*: Reduces the need for manually typing and formulating prompts.\n",
    "3. *Flexibility*: Easy to alter parameters to get varied responses.\n",
    "4. *Validation*: Helps in ensuring correct and expected variable inputs.\n",
    "5. *Model Agnostic*: Templates can be reused across different language models."
